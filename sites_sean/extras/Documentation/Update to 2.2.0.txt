Update Steps to 2.2.0

The User types Blog and Gallery have been rolled into one Blog-Gallery

Update the emum in the UserInfo to have the Blog-Gallery tag then in the 
UserInfo table replace Blog and Gallery with Blog-Gallery

Here is the SQL

ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_UserInfo` CHANGE `pwRightsID` `pwRightsID` ENUM( 'Administrator', 'SuperUser', 'Blog-Gallery' ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Administrator' COMMENT 'This syncs with the rights table';

This actually nulls all Blog or Gallery types so the following will
fix that mess...

ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_UserInfo` CHANGE `pwRightsID` `pwRightsID` ENUM( 'Administrator', 'SuperUser', 'Blog-Gallery' ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Administrator' COMMENT 'This syncs with the rights table';
UPDATE APPDEV_UserInfo SET pwRightsID='Blog-Gallery' WHERE pwRightsID='';

Add a field to the IL for a picture owner ID

ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_ImageLibrary` ADD `OwnerID` VARCHAR( 128 ) NOT NULL COMMENT 'The ID of the user who uploaded the picture' AFTER `ArtistID` ;
UPDATE APPDEV_ImageLibrary SET OwnerID=ArtistID WHERE 1;

I have changed the ecommerce sizes table to make it much more generic and not limited to flat art
There are the mods, they will not break an existing database

ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_ImageSizes` CHANGE `Description` `DescriptionOne` TEXT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL COMMENT 'The description of that size'; 
ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_ImageSizes` CHANGE `EditionType` `DescriptionTwo` TEXT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL COMMENT 'The type of edition';  

Target mode

ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_PasswordTargets` DROP `pwTargetID` 

Join now is simpler, it wants a single email address and will gen a password. 
This eliminates a bunch of possibility of user error.
From the Join page remmove the following fields - PASS, PASSCONFIRM, EMAILCONFIRM


ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_UserPermissions` ADD `pwModerator` TEXT NOT NULL AFTER `pwPermission` ,
ADD `pwContributor` TEXT NOT NULL AFTER `pwModerator` ;

UPDATE `APPDEV_UserPermissions` SET pwContributor='1' WHERE 1


ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_BLOG_CalendarBlog` CHANGE `blEventDate` `blEventDate` DATETIME NULL DEFAULT NULL 
COMMENT 'This is the event date if BlogType is CALENDAR';

 
Apply this to ALL blogs for the LIFO/FIXED blog update.
 
ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_BLOG_LifoBlog` CHANGE `blSortType` `blSortType` ENUM( 'RANDOM', 'FIXED', 'LIFO' ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT 'RANDOM' COMMENT 'This is for Ads it holds the sort type - if fixed refer to blSortOrder' 
 
2.2.0.3

I did bad when I implemented the MUSIC type blog and reused fields for things they were not ment for
to keep the schema delta down, bad. All bad.

ALTER TABLE `APPDEV_BLOG_music` ADD `blFileName` TEXT NOT NULL COMMENT 'This is the name of the media file associated with the posting for MUSIC and MOVIE blogs',
ADD `blPath` TEXT NOT NULL COMMENT 'This is the path to the media file';

The older DB have this set to RANDOM and it needs to be fixed as it was ignored for LIFO sorting.

UPDATE TABLE_NAME SET blSortType='LIFO';
